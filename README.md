# Machine_Learning_R
This repository contains all the Machine Learning projects I have done using R.

#The projects are as follows:
1) Using a basic logistic regression model, and a fine-tuned logistic regression model, with forward step-wise regression, to predict the likelihood of a person donating to a charitable cause. The data was obtained through DataCamp.

2) Comparing the performance of a K Nearest Neighbor model and a logistic regression model. Both models aim to predict the type of glass produced based on several features of the glass. The data was obtained through Kaggle.

3) Using repeated cross validation, with the caret package, and random forests to predict Person A's location based on the day and time of the week. The data consists of locations of Person A based on time and day of the week. The data was obtained through Datacamp.
